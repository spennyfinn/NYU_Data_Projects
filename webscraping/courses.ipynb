This course is an introduction to the theory and practice of public interest technology, with substantial projects that will give students the opportunity to gain experience working with external stakeholders on real public-interest issues. For example, students will have the opportunity to work on a mission-driven advocacy project on a current tech policy issue in the US, e.g., related to surveillance, privacy, or AI. Collaborating organizations that students may get to work with include the ACLU, the Policing Project at NYU Law School, the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project (STOP), and more.\\n            </p>\\n            <p>\\n            </p>\\n            <p>\\n             The aim of this course is to elaborate strategies of engagement with broader multidisciplinary social issues related to technology and the public interest. Thus the course consists of two parts: (1) a regular class meeting covering theories, practical approaches, and case studies of public interest technology, and (2) a project-based practicum in which students will work in groups with partners (individuals or organizations) to address a specific public interest issue. This course has no exam; grading will be based on project work and class participation. A majority of students\\' time will be spent collaboratively in pairs/groups for the project practicum, with weekly instructor-team meetings. In-person class attendance is required, due to the project-based and collaborative nature of the course.\\n            </p>\\n            <p>\\n            </p>\\n            <p>\\n             Admission to this course is by application only, via this form:\\n             <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1tH7jO1hyULRsF0Mdaa2dFUTVrfxoXhWTzgq_AneFNOg/edit\" target=\"_blank\">\\n              https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1tH7jO1hyULRsF0Mdaa2dFUTVrfxoXhWTzgq_AneFNOg/edit\\n             </a>\\n             Applications will be evaluated on a rolling basis starting November 11, 2024.\\n            </p>\\n           </span>\\n          </div>\\n         </li>\\n         <li class=\"row\" id=\"csci-ga3033-102\">\\n          <div>\\n           <span class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-3 italic\" style=\"word-wrap:break-word;\">\\n            <a data-placement=\"left\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" href=\"https://cs.nyu.edu/courses/spring25/CSCI-GA.3033-102/\" title=\"NYU Home login required to view course page\">\\n             CSCI-GA.3033-\\u200b102\\n            </a>\\n            <br/>\\n            (5166)\\n           </span>\\n           <span class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-3\">\\n            <a class=\"expand\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" href=\"#csci-ga3033-102-desc\">\\n             Special Topics:\\n                                  \\n                              \\n                              Learning with Large Language and Vision Models\\n            </a>\\n           </span>\\n           <span class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-2\">\\n            <a href=\"http://www.sainingxie.com/\">\\n             Saining Xie\\n            </a>\\n           </span>\\n           <span class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-2\">\\n            M 4:55-6:55PM\\n           </span>\\n           <span class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-2\">\\n            CIWW 101\\n           </span>\\n           <span class=\"col-xs-12 collapse expandable\" id=\"csci-ga3033-102-desc\">\\n            <br/>\\n            <p>\\n             This course delves into the recent advancements in deep learning made possible by the development of large pre-trained language and vision models.

Starting with the seminal work of Goemans and Williamson in early 90s, several approximation algorithms have been designed based on a semi-definite programming relaxation followed by a rounding scheme. This course\\xa0 will cover many of these SDP-based algorithms along with other applications of SDPs in computer science. The course will also cover hardness of approximation results, showing that for several NP-hard problems, it remains NP-hard to compute approximations beyond a certain threshold.\\n            </p>\\n           </span>\\n          </div>\\n         </li>\\n         <li class=\"row\" id=\"csci-ga3033-107\">\\n          <div>\\n           <span class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-3 italic\" style=\"word-wrap:break-word;\">\\n            <a data-placement=\"left\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" href=\"https://cs.nyu.edu/courses/spring25/CSCI-GA.3033-107/\" title=\"NYU Home login required to view course page\">\\n             CSCI-GA.3033-\\u200b107\\n            </a>\\n            <br/>\\n            (5168)\\n           </span>\\n           <span class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-3\">\\n            <a class=\"expand\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" href=\"#csci-ga3033-107-desc\">\\n             Special Topics:\\n                                  \\n                              \\n                              Cryptography of Blockchains\\n            </a>\\n           </span>\\n           <span class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-2\">\\n            <a href=\"http://bue.nz\">\\n             Benedikt Bünz\\n            </a>\\n           </span>\\n           <span class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-2\">\\n            M 12:30-2:30PM\\n           </span>\\n           <span class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-2\">\\n            60 Fifth Ave C15\\n           </span>\\n           <span class=\"col-xs-12 collapse expandable\" id=\"csci-ga3033-107-desc\">\\n            <br/>\\n            <p>\\n             Blockchains are distributed systems that are secured using consensus protocols, game theoretic incentives and cryptographic primitives.

Typical applications include: information extraction (automatically finding information from text); information retrieval (web searches and other applications involving the automatic selection of \"relevant\" documents); sentiment analysis (automatic extraction of opinions about a set of issues); and machine translation (automatically translating one natural language to another). Much of the best work in the field combines two methodologies: (1) automatically acquiring statistical information from one set of \"training\" documents to use as the basis for probabilistically predicting the distribution of similar information in new documents; and (2) using manually encoded linguistic knowledge. For example, many supervised methods of machine learning require: a corpus of text with manually encoded linguistic knowledge, a set of procedures for acquiring statistical patterns from this data and a transducer for predicting these same distinctions in new text. This class will cover linguistic, statistical and computational aspects of this exciting field.\\n            </p>\\n            <br/>\\n            <br/>\\n            <b>\\n             Prerequisites\\n            </b>\\n            : Computer Systems Organization (CSCI-UA 201).\\n           </span>\\n          </div>\\n         </li>\\n         <li class=\"row\" id=\"csci-ua0470-001\">\\n          <div>\\n           <span class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-3 italic\" style=\"word-wrap:break-word;\">\\n            <a data-placement=\"left\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" href=\"https://cs.nyu.edu/courses/spring25/CSCI-UA.0470-001/\" title=\"NYU Home login required to view course page\">\\n             CSCI-UA.0470-\\u200b001\\n            </a>\\n            <br/>\\n            (16897)\\n           </span>\\n           <span class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-3\">\\n            <a class=\"expand\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" href=\"#csci-ua0470-001-desc\">\\n             Object Oriented Programming\\n            </a>\\n           </span>\\n           <span class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-2\">\\n            <a href=\"https://cs.nyu.edu/~ha2285/\">\\n             Hasan Aljabbouli\\n            </a>\\n           </span>\\n           <span class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-2\">\\n            MW 9:30-10:45AM\\n           </span>\\n           <span class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-2\">\\n            Online\\n           </span>\\n           <span class=\"col-xs-12 collapse expandable\" id=\"csci-ua0470-001-desc\">\\n            <br/>\\n            <p>\\n             Introduces the important concepts of object-oriented design and languages, including code reuse, data abstraction, inheritance, and dynamic overloading.

The field of DevOps, a portmanteau of development and operations, has introduced further processes and infrastructure to automate many of the tasks required in such development. Together, an Agile methodology and DevOps automation have increased the speed, robustness, and scalability with which software is developed today and have reduced the uncertainty of outcomes inherent in complex software development. Upon completion of this course, students will understand the core methodologies, technologies, and tools used in the software industry today.\\n            </p>\\n            <br/>\\n            <br/>\\n            <b>\\n             Prerequisites\\n            </b>\\n            : CSCI-UA.0201 with a grade of C or better\\n           </span>\\n          </div>\\n         </li>\\n         <li class=\"row\" id=\"csci-ua0480-075\">\\n          <div>\\n           <span class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-3 italic\" style=\"word-wrap:break-word;\">\\n            <a data-placement=\"left\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" href=\"https://cs.nyu.edu/courses/spring25/CSCI-UA.0480-075/\" title=\"NYU Home login required to view course page\">\\n             CSCI-UA.0480-\\u200b075\\n            </a>\\n            <br/>\\n            (23956)\\n           </span>\\n           <span class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-3\">\\n            <a class=\"expand\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" href=\"#csci-ua0480-075-desc\">\\n             Special Topics:\\n                                  \\n                              \\n                              Introduction to Deep Learning\\n            </a>\\n           </span>\\n           <span class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-2\">\\n            <a href=\"https://atcold.github.io/\">\\n             Alfredo Canziani\\n            </a>\\n           </span>\\n           <span class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-2\">\\n            TR 12:30-1:45PM\\n           </span>\\n           <span class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-2\">\\n            CIWW 202\\n           </span>\\n           <span class=\"col-xs-12 collapse expandable\" id=\"csci-ua0480-075-desc\">\\n            <br/>\\n            <p>\\n             This course provides a comprehensive introduction to deep learning, exploring fundamental architectures, theoretical foundations, and practical applications of neural network models.

The topics covered include structure of one-pass and multiple-pass compilers; symbol table management; lexical analysis; traditional and automated parsing techniques, including recursive descent and LR parsing; syntax-directed translation and semantic analysis; run-time storage management; intermediate code generation; introduction to optimization; and code generation. The course includes a special compiler-related capstone project, which ties together concepts of algorithms, theory (formal languages), programming languages, software engineering, computer architecture, and other subjects covered in the MS curriculum. This project requires a substantial semester-long programming effort, such as construction of a language compilation or translation system that includes lexical and syntactic analyzers, a type checker, and a code generator.\n",

On the other, It will cover methods for applying this knowledge using both manual rules and machine learning. Sample topics include: formal languages, hmm, part of speech tagging, vector-based methods, shallow and full parsing, semantic role labeling, information extraction and machine translation. Students will complete shared tasks (POS-tagging, Information Extraction, etc.) and group final projects.  There will also be a midterm exam and several small written assignments.</p>\n",

In this class we will look at how to construct these distributed systems, in particular looking at why this is more complex than building applications running on a single machine, and present abstraction and design techniques for building distributed systems. We will focus on a solving a variety of common problems in these systems including consensus, consistency, naming, fault tolerance, etc.</p>\n",

       "<p>This course is a capstone course that introduces the latest cloud multi-access computing platform services including support for Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Web3 decentralized platforms, and other technologies. These services may be leveraged to create industry 4.0 and 5.0 innovative Intelligent Autonomous Networked (IAN) business solutions and deploy them on hybrid multi-cloud platforms so they can operate at the network edge to minimize latency and power consumption. Students will learn about services provided on the top “Big Clouds”, namely Amazon AWS Cloud, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure Cloud, IBM Cloud, Oracle Cloud, Salesforce, and others. Related services provided on the Cloud and covered in the course include computing and hosting services, storage services, networking services, container management services (e.g., K8s), and shallow/deep machine learning services. Once familiar with Cloud services, Students will learn how to combine them to support cognitive computing and enable the creation of IAN solutions that cater to the practical needs of industry 4.0/5.0 and society 5.0 users in novel and creative ways. As they create these IAN solutions, students will learn about immersive Augmented/Virtual Reality (AR/VR) User Experience and Interfaces (UX/UI), hybrid decentralized computing and DApps, multi-access computing and Internet of Things (IoT), Mobility/5G networking and Software Defined Network (SDN) infrastructures, advanced robotics, and various key aspects of digital security that are critical to ensure the safety of modern software solutions.

We will see how this challenge is greatly simplified by modern programming languages and programming techniques, especially functional programming techniques which make it possible to quickly develop efficient, scalable, and correct implementations. Prior experience with functional programming is helpful but not required. Students will learn how to design, analyze, implement, and evaluate the performance of parallel algorithms across a variety of problem domains (e.g., graph analysis, computational geometry, numerical algorithms, image processing, etc.). In the second half of the course, students will complete a parallel programming project of their own design.</p>\n",

To the extent feasible, the mathematical properties of the cryptographic algorithms are justified, using elementary mathematical tools. Second, actual security mechanisms and protocols, mainly those employed for network traffic that rely on the previously introduced cryptographic algorithms, are presented. The topics covered include introduction to basic number-theoretical properties, public/private and symmetric key systems, secure hash functions, digital signature standards, digital certificates, IP security, e-mail security, Web security, and stand-alone computer privacy and security tools.\n",

       "<p>This is a capstone course that connects students directly with real-world information technology problems. The goal of this course is to teach the skills needed for success in real-world information technology via a combination of classroom lectures and practical experience with large projects that have been specified by local “clients.” The typical clients are primarily companies, but can also be government agencies or nonprofit organizations. Each project lasts for the entire semester and is designed to involve the full software project life cycle. Examples of such projects are development of software to solve a business problem, including specifying requirements, writing and testing prototype code, and writing a final report; and evaluation of commercial software to be purchased to address a business problem, including gathering requirements, designing an architecture to connect the new software with existing systems, and assessing the suitability of available software products.</p>\n",

       "<p>Natural Language Processing (aka Computational Linguistics) is an inter-disciplinary field applying methodology of computer science and linguistics to the processing of natural languages (English, Chinese, Spanish, Japanese, etc.). Typical applications include: information extraction (automatically finding information from text); information retrieval (web searches and other applications involving the automatic selection of \"relevant\" documents); sentiment analysis (automatic extraction of opinions about a set of issues); and machine translation (automatically translating one natural language to another). Much of the best work in the field combines two methodologies: (1) automatically acquiring statistical information from one set of \"training\" documents to use as the basis for probabilistically predicting the distribution of similar information in new documents; and (2) using manually encoded linguistic knowledge. For example, many supervised methods of machine learning require: a corpus of text with manually encoded linguistic knowledge, a set of procedures for acquiring statistical patterns from this data and a transducer for predicting these same distinctions in new text. This class will cover linguistic, statistical and computational aspects of this exciting field.</p>\n",

It begins with an overview of the philosophy and brief history of open source development, followed by an in-depth look at different types of open source projects and the study of various tools involved in open source development. In particular, it covers the collaborative nature of open source projects, community structure, version control systems, licensing, intellectual property, types of contributions (programming and non-programming) and the tool-chains that enable such contributions. The students are expected to contribute to existing open source projects.</span></span></span></p>\n",

The field of DevOps, a portmanteau of development and operations, has introduced further processes and infrastructure to automate many of the tasks required in such development. Together, an Agile methodology and DevOps automation have increased the speed, robustness, and scalability with which software is developed today and have reduced the uncertainty of outcomes inherent in complex software development. Upon completion of this course, students will understand the core methodologies, technologies, and tools used in the software industry today.</p>\n",

The course includes a special compiler-related capstone project, which ties together concepts of algorithms, theory (formal languages), programming languages, software engineering, computer architecture, and other subjects covered in the MS curriculum. This project requires a substantial semester-long programming effort, such as construction of a language compilation or translation system that includes lexical and syntactic analyzers, a type checker, and a code generator.\n",

       "<p>This course is based on Steve Blank’s Lean LaunchPad curriculum. This course provides real world, hands­ on learning on what it’s like to actually start a high­ tech company. This is a practical class – essentially a lab, not a theory or “book” class. The goal, within the constraints of a classroom and a limited amount of time, is to create an entrepreneurial experience for students with all of the pressures and demands of the real world in an early stage start up. Students will talk to customers, partners, competitors, as they encounter the chaos and uncertainty of how a startup actually works. They will work in teams learning how to turn a great idea into a great company. They will learn how to use a business model to brainstorm each part of a company and customer development to get out of the classroom to see whether anyone would want/use their product. Finally, based on the customer and market feedback gathered, students will use agile development to rapidly iterate their products to build something customers would actually use and buy. Each day will be a new adventure outside the classroom as students test each part of their business model and then share the hard earned knowledge with the rest of the class.</p>\n",

The goal of this course is to teach the skills needed for success in real-world information technology via a combination of classroom lectures and practical experience with large projects that have been specified by local “clients.” The typical clients are primarily companies, but can also be government agencies or nonprofit organizations. Each project lasts for the entire semester and is designed to involve the full software project life cycle. Examples of such projects are development of software to solve a business problem, including specifying requirements, writing and testing prototype code, and writing a final report; and evaluation of commercial software to be purchased to address a business problem, including gathering requirements, designing an architecture to connect the new software with existing systems, and assessing the suitability of available software products.</p>\n",

       "<p>Natural Language Processing (aka Computational Linguistics) is an inter-disciplinary field applying methodology of computer science and linguistics to the processing of natural languages (English, Chinese, Spanish, Japanese, etc.). Typical applications include: information extraction (automatically finding information from text); information retrieval (web searches and other applications involving the automatic selection of \"relevant\" documents); sentiment analysis (automatic extraction of opinions about a set of issues); and machine translation (automatically translating one natural language to another). Much of the best work in the field combines two methodologies: (1) automatically acquiring statistical information from one set of \"training\" documents to use as the basis for probabilistically predicting the distribution of similar information in new documents; and (2) using manually encoded linguistic knowledge. For example, many supervised methods of machine learning require: a corpus of text with manually encoded linguistic knowledge, a set of procedures for acquiring statistical patterns from this data and a transducer for predicting these same distinctions in new text. This class will cover linguistic, statistical and computational aspects of this exciting field.</p>\n",
